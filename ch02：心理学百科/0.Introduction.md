Psychology

Psychology is the science of behavior and mind, including conscious and unconscious phenomena, as well as thought. It is an academic discipline of immense scope and diverse interests that, when taken together, seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, and all the variety of epiphenomena they manifest. As a social science it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases.

心理学是关于行为和心理的学科，包括意识和潜意识现象，以及想法。它是一个汇集多种不同兴趣、范围广泛的一个学科，目的在于探究大脑的突发性质和它所代表的各种附带现象。作为一种社会科学，其宗旨在于通过探寻普遍规则和研究特殊案例来理解个人和群体。

In this field, a professional practitioner or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive scientist. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.

在这一领域中，一个专业的从业者或者研究人员被称为心理学家，也可以被对垒为社会科学家，行为科学家，或认知科学家。心理学家们努力理解个人和社会行为中大脑功能的作用，同时也探寻认知功能和行为背后的物理和生理进程。

Psychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including perception, cognition, attention, emotion (affect), intelligence, phenomenology, motivation (conation), brain functioning, and personality. This extends to interaction between people, such as interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind. Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In addition, or in opposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, some—especially clinical and counseling psychologists—at times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques. Psychology has been described as a "hub science",with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, humanities, and philosophy.

心理学家们探究行为和心理进程，包括直觉、认知、注意、情绪（情感）、智商、现象、动机（意动）、大脑功能和人的性格。并且拓展到人与人之间的互动，比如人际关系，包括心理弹性，家庭弹性以及其他的领域。研究方向不用的心理学家们也关注潜意识。心理学家们应用经验方法去推论心理变量之间的因果关系和相关关系。除此之外，或者从相反的角度来说，应用经验和演绎方法，尤其是临床和咨询心理学，有些时候依靠象征性的解释和其他归纳技巧。心理学被描述为一种“中心科学”。心理学发现与社会科学、自然科学、医药学、人类学和哲学的研究和视角相联系。

While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts psychology ultimately aims to benefit society.The majority of psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing in clinical, counseling, or school settings. Many do scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior, and typically work in university psychology departments or teach in other academic settings (e.g., medical schools, hospitals). Some are employed in industrial and organizational settings, or in other areas[7] such as human development and aging, sports, health, and the media, as well as in forensic investigation and other aspects of law.

在心理学知识经常被应用在心理健康的评估和治疗的同时，它还旨在理解和解决人类活动的几个领域中的问题。从很多方面来讲，心理学最终的目的是为造福社会。大部分的心理学家都涉足一些治疗角色，在诊所职业，咨询或学校。很多人也真多心理过程和行为相关的主题进行广泛的科学研究，通常是在大学心理部门工作或者在其他学术机构教学（如医学院，医院等）。有些人也在工业和机构中任职，也有在其他领域，如人类发展和老龄化，运动，健康，媒体，以及法医调查和法律的其他方面。
