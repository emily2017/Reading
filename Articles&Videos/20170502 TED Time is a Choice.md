# 20170502 TED:time is a choice 

如何管理自由时间

we don't build the life we want by saving time, we build the life we want, and then time saves itself.
time is highly elastic.we can't make more time,  but time will stretch to accomodate what we choose do put into it .
the key to time management is treating our priorities as the equavalate of that broken whter heater. 
everything i do, very minute i spent, is my choice.

i don't do 1,2,3 because it's not a priority. instead of i don't have time to do 1,2,3
i don't have time = it's not an priority.
we are smart people, and certainly over the long run, we have power to fill our life with    the things that deserve to be there.

1. find what they are: write 6-10 goals of next year in the end of the year
    * write next year's performance review:
    * what 3-5 things would make it a great year for your professionally?
    * write the family holiday letter
    * what 3-5 things would make it a great year for you personally
2. break these goals down into doable steps 
  * write a family history:
  * read some other family histories,get a sense of the style
  * think about the questions you want to ask your relatives 
  * set up  appointments to interview them 
  * run a 5k
     1. find a race and sign up 
       2. figure out a trainning plan 
       3. find the running shoes 
  3. make yourself a three-category priority list:
  * career
  * relationships
  * self 
    →there should be something in all three categories
    →2-3items each
     → loot out over the whole of the next week, and see where you can plan them in 

we treat our priorities as the equavalate of the broken water heater by puting them into our schedules first 
and we do this by thinking through our weeks before we are in them._friday afternoon(low opportunity cost time)

24x7=168hours in a week 
full time job: 40 hours a week 
sleeping :  56 hours a week =8hours a night
→70 hours for other things
in 168 hours a week,i think we can find time for what matters to you 
we don't need that much time to do amazing things. small moments can have great power.
you can use your bits of time for bits of joy 
look at the whole of one's time, and seeing where the good stuff can go .
even if we are busy, we have time fo what matters , and when we focus on what matters, we can build the life we want  in the time we've got
